# Remote-Control Toolkit

This project was a learning experience on how SSH and terminal emulation worked.

# Is This Project Deprecated?
No, at some point, some of the bugs with SSH will be fixed. The code-base will also be refactored.

# The Purpose
Remote-Control Toolkit is a different implementation of a previous remote-control project I worked on. The previous implementation used WCF as the network-layer. This project
uses SSH and terminal escape-sequences. When working on this project, I became fascinated on how terminals and BASH worked. As part of the learning experience, I attempted to
replicate the core parts of the BASH shell.
